# 360SALROI: Hybrid Saliency RoI Ranking in 360-degree Videos

This is a pre-print page of the actual research that I am conducting as one of the PhD. Student sub projects performing the scientific project *PES360: Perceptually-Efficient Streaming of 360-degree Edited Videos*. Looking foward to stimulate active scientific collaboration this repository will register the links to find the key components of the project findings and works, as well as the *created datasets* and developed *source codes*.   

The static github page source was kindly offered by [Peerj](https://import.github.com/new/?import_url=https://github.com/peerj/paper-now/).
